Disclaimer:
This documentation and code are not indicative of best practices in terms of HTTP handling and security. Proceed with the notion that there may very well be additional security measures necessary for your specific use case. This paper was written by a conceited Wago engineer that thinks of himself as a programmer and has a fascination with automated cloud processes.

Much like the Temple of Doom (a REALLY old movie starring Kylo Renâ€™s dad), proceed at your own risk!
